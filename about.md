Hello! My name is Thomas Maddox.

I've been involved in technology since I was a kid, building and maintaining websites for whatever video game I was playing at the time, and hacking away in my Java lab in high school. Nowadays I'm developing software for and based around OpenStack at Rackspace.

I have been lucky enough in my career to work on all layers of the software stack, including a fair amount of DevOps / systems engineering work as well, and very much enjoy different aspects of working on all of the components that make software happen. More recently, with OpenStack, I've done everything from using Python on tooling for database load testing, to integrating with technologies like RabbitMQ, OpenVSwitch, Libvirt, to downstream analytics with Graphite and a custom reporting engine, to deployment automation using Ansible and Puppet, all the way to AngularJS, HTML5, and CSS3 for our web interface.

Three things that make me tick are elegant, simple solutions, consistent user experiences, and continually improving myself and the code I write.

Overall, I'm a candid, inquisitive, sillyheart who wants to get his hands dirty and write some kickass software.
